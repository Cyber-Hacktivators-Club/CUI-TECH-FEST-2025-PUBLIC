  I had been tracking a cybercriminal for several months when, one night, I finally got the chance to capture him. But everything went wrong—he turned the tables and took me captive instead. 
  During my confinement, I once caught a glimpse of his Instagram profile: something blue, serpent-like. The image stuck in my mind, though the details are hazy.

  Two days later, I managed to escape, taking with me two URLs that could be key to uncovering his identity. I didn’t fully understand their significance at first, which is why I need your help now—to solve this case once and for all and bring the serpent to justice.

  Unmask the serpent. End this hunt.
