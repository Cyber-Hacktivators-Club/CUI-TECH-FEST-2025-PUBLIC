Challenge name : "Am i The First Monster?"
AUTHOR = The_Blue_Serpent

Description : Something weird’s happening in the server.
Last night, someone joined—no one knows who is he , no roles, no messages . Though some say he was one of the very first members to ever join… and never once spoke.:

"Can you see me? Even though your eyes are getting worse and worse, if I'm this close, you should be able to see me.
Can you see what's reflected in my eyes? I was born in a town that was straight out of a fairytale. Many people died.
I held the hand of my other half and walked. There were only two like us. We didn't have names...."

major hint  : Everyone thought it was a bot or a joke, until the username started showing up in the member list… then disappearing again.
Some people swear they saw it typing.
Others claim the user’s hidden in plain sight—buried in the roles, lurking in the emojis, or maybe talking in a channel nobody else can see.

they will search for the character and try to find it on the discord , from discord , they will gwt links and from there , they will  learn that the user is a ctf player in The official Owlsec ctf team
then the players will go to ctf time to search for the team "ÖWLSEC" and after that they will see my profile in the team members and form there , they will when they will click on my profile , they will see some links there as well to , but one of then leads to my spotify playlist 
and there every first letter of the song makes up the word "BLODWYRMKINDEL" which translates to the offspring of the blood serpent
