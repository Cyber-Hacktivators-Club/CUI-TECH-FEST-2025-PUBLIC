  Something weird is happening in the server.
  Last night, someone joined the server—no one knows who is he , no logs, no roles, no messages. 
  Though some say he was one of the very first members to ever join… and never once spoke,Still able to transfer data through words somehow:

    "Can you see me? Even though your eyes are getting worse and worse, if I'm this close, you should be able to see me.
      Can you see what's reflected in my eyes? I was born in a town that was straight out of a fairytale. Many people died.
      I held the hand of my other half and walked. There were only two like us. We didn't have names...."
