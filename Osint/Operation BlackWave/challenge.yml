  OPERATION BLACKWAVE

  Hey investigators, curiosity addicts, and people who enjoy mild chaos,

  Cyber Hacktivators Club has been catalogued, boxed, and quietly moved.
  An archive has been taken under a single label and I’m the one holding it.
  If you want to follow the breadcrumbs, that’s your job — not mine.

  What was taken:
    • Archive ID: BLACKWAVE-2025-09-21
    • What’s inside: project manifests, chat backups, drafts, and audit traces
    • Why it matters: enough to trace who changed what, when, and why

  Deadline:
    • 17:00 PKT, 5 November 2025

  Demands (read carefully; this is the fun part):
    • Run the attached challenge EXE. It contains a series of puzzles/questions.
    • Work it out yourself — the EXE will hand you the flag when you succeed.
    • Do not ask for flags, keys, shortcuts, or pity. This is self-service OSINT.
    • If you enjoy theatrics, bring a strong cup of coffee and a spreadsheet.

  Consequences (if you ignore the fun and decide not to play):
    • The archive may be released in public slices. People who care about receipts will pay attention.

  This note is the scenario brief. Everything you need to start is in this text and in the EXE attached to the challenge. No attachments are embedded here — the EXE is your playground.
